# Real-Time Sentiment Analysis Using Kafka and Spark Streaming

The project involves creating a sentiment analysis model using Spark MLlib, a machine learning library for the Apache Spark framework. The model will be trained on a dataset of user comments and their associated sentiments, such as positive or negative. The model will be able to predict the sentiment of new comments as they are ingested in real time by Kafka, a popular open-source streaming platform.

Once the initial model has been trained, the project will involve implementing a mechanism to periodically retrain the model as new data is added to the dataset. This will ensure that the model remains accurate and up-to-date.

A sentiment analysis model is a type of natural language processing (NLP) model that is used to identify and extract subjective information from text data. In this project, we will be using the Spark MLlib library to train a sentiment analysis model on a dataset of user comments. The model will be able to classify the sentiment of new comments as positive, negative, or neutral.

Overall, this project will result in a sentiment analysis model that is able to classify the sentiment of user comments in real-time, using the power of Spark MLlib and Kafka.
